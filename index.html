        <h2>Understanding Medicare</h2>
        <p>If you're approaching your Medicare transition or have experienced it from helping a parent, you know that Medicare is nothing short of <em>CONFUSING!</em> <a href="https://cms.gov">CMS</a> gives you a fat booklet that's supposed to teach you everything you need to know, but frankly it's not an easy read. On top of that, you have every friend, neighbor, family member, and their dog giving you their opinion on what to do for your situation, AND you have no shortage of advertisements and mail just to throw fuel on the fire. Everyone's situation is unique, and we understand that it is extremely overwhelming to have all of this pressure thrown on you. That's where we come in!</p>
