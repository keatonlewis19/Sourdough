            <p>"The origins of bread-making are so ancient that we are unable to say for certain, but the first recorded civilization we know of that made sourdough bread was the Egyptians around 1500 BC.</p>

            <p>There are many theories as to how they first discovered it, but we can assume that it was by accident. It’s thought that the Egyptian people left some out and some of the wild yeast spores in the air mixed with the dough, which caused it to rise and create sourdough bread as we know it.</p>

            <p>It’s widely known that the Egyptians also made a lot of beer and the brewery and the bakery were often in the same place, as proved by wall paintings and analyses of desiccated bread loaves and beer remains. It’s thought that abatch of flour may have been mixed with beer and produced a light loaf of bread, or the wild yeast spores were thick from the brewing and were mixed into the bread doughs, which caused them to rise considerably more than the usual wild sourdoughs.</p>

            <p>Through trial and error they found out that some of these sourdough cultures worked and tasted better than others. They could keep this culture alive by saving some raw dough from their baking and adding more flour to it. This is how sourdough starter was born."</p>

                    <p class="lighter">The starter, or "The Mother" is a living mixture that is used to help the bread rise instead of using traditional yeast. The main difference between Sourdough Bread and other breads is the yeast that is used to help the dough rise. Most breads today use dry yeasts that come in small packets or jars. With sourdough, a natural yeast is created from essentially fermenting flour and water. Depending on the type of flour that you use, you can create a variety of flavors and levels of sour in your bread.</p>

                    <p class="lighter">Because your starter is a living mixture full of different bacterias, you have to take care of it like you would a pet. It takes nurturing and feeding to keep it alive.</p>
