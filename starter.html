            <div class="div-line"></div> 
            <p>"A sourdough starter is a symbiotic community of lactic acid bacteria and wild yeast. Both yeast and bacteria feed on the carbohydrates present in flour when hydrated with water and allowed to ferment. As you refresh the starter with new “food,” each microbe gets stronger and more vivacious, releasing gases (providing air and lift) as they consume. These two live microorganisms exist in harmony within your starter, creating an environment rich with lactic and acetic acid. These acids provide both flavor and nutritional benefit."</p>

                    <li><b>Take out of the refrigerator.</b> <em class="add-on">(When not currently using or feeding your starter, it's best to keep it in the fridge to slow the feeding process and fermentation until you are ready to bake with it.)</em></li>
                    <li><b>Place your container on a kitchen scale set to grams.</b> <em class="add-on">(Be sure to measure out your container before ever using it to know how much weight to subtract to give you the correct amount of starter.)</em></li>
                    <li><b>Add 90&deg;F Water and Preferred Flour in a proportionate amount to the amount of starter you currently have. The warm water will create an environment for the bacteria to grow and feed.</b> <em class="add-on">(Depending on how much starter you want, you will feed an equal part of water to flour [1:1 ratio]. If using it for baking, then at least add the same amount of flour and water to the amount of starter you have [Ex. 150g of starter = 150g of Water + 150g of Flour]. This will double the size of your starter. If just feeding it, then at least do 50g of Water and 50g of Flour. There's strategy in how you feed your starter, and you can learn more in the "Adjusting the Sour" section below.)</em></li>
                    <li><b>Mix thoroughly with a fork or wisk.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Set container on the counter with the lid on loosely to allow some gasses to escape.</b> <em class="add-on">(If you're just feeding your starter, then let it sit for 3-4 hours, discard any extra starter, [you'll always want to have at least 100g in your container,] and then place it back in the refrigerator. If using for baking, then leave it out all night in preparation to start making it in the morning.) </em></li>
                </ol>

                <p class="lighter" style="text-align:center;">You'll eventually find your own way that works best for you in feeding and taking care of your starter. Feeding it once a week or every two weeks is sufficient to keep it alive. If you go too long without feeding it, (usually more than a month,) you may need to revive it by feeding it once a day until it's actively growing again. In some cases you may need to just get a new bit of starter to work with. You can find many resources online that cater to the condition of your starter.</p>

Some people like a mild sour taste while others prefer the rich sour taste that makes sourdough what it is known for.
